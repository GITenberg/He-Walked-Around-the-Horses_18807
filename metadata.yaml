description: Science fiction author H. Beam Piper is regarded as one of the genre's
  most inventive practitioners, and this short but gripping tale puts his remarkable
  creative powers on full display. "He Walked Around the Horses" takes the real-world
  case of the mysterious disappearance of a nineteenth-century diplomat and melds
  it into a mind-bending science fiction story. Fans of speculative SF will love this
  gratifying read.
